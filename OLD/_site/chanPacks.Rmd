# Overview

This is an indexed and lightly annotated catalog of packages
developed in our group.  Many of these packages need additional
support (unit tests, vignette improvements, migration of
large serializations to ExperimentHub or AnnotationHub).  Notes
on development priorities are in the next section, followed
by the list of packages.

# Development priorities as of June 23 2019

## Overall

Unit testing coverage needs to be addressed for all packages.

## Cancer genomics

- The vignette of [BiocOncoTk](#bco) includes a number of outreach
tasks that have not been addressed well.  Cleaner interfaces to
cBioPortal, TIES, additional work on CPTAC...
- The nested dependency structure of blocks in [ivygapSE](#ivy) data
needs to be addressed to support valid inference on donor-level
covariate associations
- The [tumex5](#te5) package demonstrates MAE with HSDS back
end and more work is needed to broaden scope of assay coverage
and back end flexibility
